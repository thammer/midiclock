# midiclock

`midiclock` is a small web app that listens for incoming MIDI clock messages via the Web MIDI API and shows tempo in BPM for each connected MIDI input device.

## Purpose

- Provide a lightweight BPM monitor for external MIDI clock sources.
- Show one tempo readout per connected device in a simple dark-mode interface.
- Keep the project dependency-free at runtime (plain HTML, CSS, and TypeScript-compiled JavaScript).

## Vibe-coding experiment

This project is also a vibe-coding experiment: I do not read code or edit files manually. All project updates are done through chat with coding agents in Cursor IDE.
